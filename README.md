The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find actual data I am currently working with. I was able to create visualizations of how our commands budget is spent (number of transactions and dollar amount, both by transaction type).

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.
